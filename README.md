Prototype Extension manager for Delphi Rad Studio

Discussions will be used to set some requirements for a possible Extension manager similar to VS Code

A Delphi developers day is spent in Rad Studio. IDE experts can optimize some functions in the IDE but there is little confidence in which experts work in each version and how to find them.  

As an Expert developer I do not know:
What Expert versions are being used in which version of the IDE
How many downloads vs uninstalls
Basic rating of satisfaction
