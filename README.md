Prototype Extension manager for Delphi Rad Studio

Discussions will be used to set some requirements for a possible Extension manager similar to VS Code

A Delphi developers day is spent in Rad Studio. IDE experts can optimize some functions in the IDE but there is little confidence in which experts work in each version and how to find them.

As an Expert developer I do not know:

* What Expert versions are being used in which version of the IDE
* How many downloads vs uninstalls
* Basic rating of satisfaction

Challenges to developing an maintained expert. Developers will pay a small amount if the expert fixes a problem.  The expert must be delivered compiled with source code as a backup in case the mainatiner gives up.

## Paid version distribution

An expert developer needs to have a whitebox client that can provide the following:

* Validate a license code
* Download new versions
* Install to multiple versions of the IDE
* Allow selecting back versions of the expert
* Validate and Repair settings for the IDE by version
* Allow installation to alternate IDE profiles
* Temporarily disable an expert for troubleshooting
